# My Diary

### **Summary**

Personal, encrypted with AES, simple(st), offline, secure, feature-poor :) desktop diary app. I develop this app in 2016 because I was bored  :) in this app you can't delete or alter diaries. Diaries stored as encryted with AES algorithm, you can see diaries only within the app. So don't lose .users file and don't forget username and password.

### **Instalition**

Clone project to your local storage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/metinUr/My-Diary.git && cd My-Diary
```
then you can create jar file from source or open jar file already created with
```bash
java -jar out/artifacts/myDiary_jar/myDiary.jar
```
commad or just double-click.

> **Note**: If you move jar file somewhere else move it with upper folder because user accounts and diaries wil be in upper folder called .users after create an account. So you should put .users file in same folder with jar file.
